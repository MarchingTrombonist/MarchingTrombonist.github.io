                <li>This is a modding application I wrote in Auto Hotkey (AHK) for the videogame Celeste. It allows you
                    to create
                    custom presets of mods or modpacks so that you can de/activate them all at once.</li>

                <li>I started working here in June 2023 as a member of their first ever cohort of summer interns, and
                    the opportunity then got extended into a part-time job that will be ending mid-October. I've had the
                    opportunity to work with proprietary software and a company codebase, along with meet dozens of
                    incredible people.</li>

                <li>I've worked as a tutor since I was a sophomore in high school, and since coming to college I've
                    recieved professional training through working at the On-Campus tutoring center and am now a CRLA
                    Level 3 certified tutor. I'm super super passionate about educating people, and I love when I'm able
                    to explain something and see someone else understand it in the same way I do.</li>
